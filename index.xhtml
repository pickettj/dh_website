        <h3><a href="description.xhtml">Course Description</a></h3>
        <p>This course is modeled very closely on one pioneered by emeritus Pitt Professor <a href="https://www.slavic.pitt.edu/people/david-j-birnbaum">David Birnbaum</a>, and we will be using much of the material available on his website: Obdurodon. (What is an "Obdurodon," you ask? An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obdurodon">extinct platypus with molars</a>, apparently... don't worry about it.) For our purposes, <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/">Obdurodon functions as an encylcopedia of information</a> essential for this course, and many of the links to coding assignments on the <a href="syllabus.xhtml">syllabus</a> redirect there as well. Just bear in mind that specific course information on Obdurodon (e.g., due dates, classroom assignments) may relate to a previous semester. For a more detailed description of assignments and policies, <a href="description.xhtml">follow this link</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>Dr. Birnbaum summed up the impetus for this course as follows: <blockquote>"Humanities students often do not realize (or even imagine) that 1) they are capable of learning to write useful and practical computer programs within the course of a semester even if they have no prior background in programming; 2) the ability to write oneâ€™s own programs can be valuable for scholars in the humanities, especially because commercial software often does not address research needs in the humanities; and 3) practical computer programming, no less than reading, writing, and arithmetic, is a useful skill that is within the reach of any educated person regardless of academic specialization."</blockquote></p>
