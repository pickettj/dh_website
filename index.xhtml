        <p>This course is modeled very closely on one pioneered by emeritus Pitt Professor <a href="https://www.slavic.pitt.edu/people/david-j-birnbaum">David Birnbaum</a>, and we will be using much of the material available on Obdurodon. (What is an "Obdurodon," you ask? An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obdurodon">extinct platypus with molars</a> apparently... don't worry about it.) For your purposes, <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/">Obdurodon functions as an encylcopedia of information</a> essential for this course. Just bear in mind that information on Obdurodon with specific course information (e.g., due dates, classroom assignments) may relate to a previous semester. For assignments and policies, refer to this site or Canvas. 
        </p>
        <p>Dr. Birnbaum summed up the impetus for this course as follows: "Humanities students often do not realize (or even imagine) that 1) they are capable of learning to write useful and practical computer programs within the course of a semester even if they have no prior background in programming; 2) the ability to write oneâ€™s own programs can be valuable for scholars in the humanities, especially because commercial software often does not address research needs in the humanities; and 3) practical computer programming, no less than reading, writing, and arithmetic, is a useful skill that is within the reach of any educated person regardless of academic specialization."</p>
