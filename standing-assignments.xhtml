        <h2>Standing Assignments</h2>

        <p>In addition to coding assignments; response papers; and unit tests; the following "standing assignments" are due on a weekly / monthly basis (all on TopHat). (Note that TopHat does <a href="https://success.tophat.com/s/article/Professor-Including-programming-syntax-in-Questions-and-Discussions">support code blocks</a> : [code]write your code here[/code].)</p>


        <h3>Discussion Forum Post</h3>

        <p>Despite the image of the programmer as a solitary soul bent over a glowing screen in a cubicle, programming is, in reality, a social activity, and real programmers make liberal use of discussion forums to ask and answer questions. Furthermore, despite the classroom tradition where students submit homework to a professor, who grades and returns it, so that nobody else ever sees it, that’s not the way coding works in the real world and it’s not the model in this course. Like real developers, we ask and answer questions in the open. This course component has two principal goals: 1) it provides a forum to ask and answer questions, and 2) it helps course participants become familiar with an industry-standard discussion platform.</p>

        <p>Each student is required to read all new discussion postings and contribute at least one posting per unit to the general discussion: ask a question, answer a question (comment on an existing posting, typically in a thread), make a suggestion, pass along a link to a site that showed you something you could use in your project (and explain what it is and why it was useful), etc. A discussion forum will be posted on TopHat for each course unit (i.e., one forum for XML, another for RelaxNG, etc.). Periodically throughout the semester, your instructors will also ask you to respond to a particular posting on TopHat, and your response will be evaluated for, among other things, its thoughtfulness and consideration of other student responses. The syllabus will clearly note these Single-Issue responses, which will serve as that week's Class Discussion Posting.</p>

        <p>Participation in the discussion beyond the minimum requirement is strongly encouraged. Don’t be shy about asking questions in this forum; your instructors do this all the time in their own work, and you can’t learn to code if you don’t learn how to participate in a coding community. And don’t be shy about answering questions, which is both good citizenship and personally satisfying. Much of the classroom time will be devoted to teacher-centered instruction, and the discussion framework offers an opportunity to interact with classmates to cultivate a community in which peers provide insight, solutions, and general discussion. This discussion forum should be the first resource for questions, comments, etc.</p>

        <p>Over the course of the semester it is likely that you will find a technology or software we use to be frustrating. Please keep your postings professional and respectful.</p>

        <h3>Friday: Project Update</h3>

        <p>Before Friday’s class each project team (at least one posting per team, not per person, although more are welcome) must create one new Issue (labeled as Project update using the issue-labeling feature of GitHub; ask your project mentor to show you how to set this up) in their project repo. These postings should be brief but informative status reports about your projects: what you accomplished in the preceding week, what you learned, where you got stuck, etc., as well was what you plan to do in the upcoming week. Reports must address both the state of the project in general and the specific weekly contributions of each of the individual team members.</p>

        <h3>Monthly Project Update Responses</h3>

        <p>Once the weekly project updates begin, each student is required to read all new Issue postings on the other project repos and respond to at least one status report by another team each month. These responses may be brief, but they need to be thoughtful, something more than nice job! or very interesting! or I look forward to seeing what you do next! You might make a suggestion, offer a critique, ask (or answer) a question, discuss how something in someone else’s posting gives you an idea of something to do on your own project, share a link to a resource you discovered that might be useful for the other team, etc. You will find it helpful to follow the other teams’ repos, which you can do by clicking the Watch button at the top of their repo page. Issue responses are also assessed as check plus, check, and check minus.
