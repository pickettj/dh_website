        <h1>ArcGIS Online Tutorial</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <section>
            <p> For this <a href="geomapping-assignment-02.xhtml">class/assignment</a>, we will be
                producing GeoJSON file using XSLT. This tutorial will walk you through the steps for
                making a map from that GeoJSON file using ArcGIS. Note, however, that there are many
                other applications that can read GeoJSON files as an input: <a
                    href="https://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> (an open-source, free GUI), <a
                    href="https://maximromanov.github.io/rgis_univie2021/">R</a>, and <a
                    href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, to name a few. We are starting with
                ArgGIS because Pitt has a subsription to an online version that requires no
                installation.</p>
            <!--<ul>
                <li>Open up an Excel Document</li>
                <li>You need at least 4 "columns:" a unique id (ie: 1, 2, 3, ...); a name (for
                    example, the location's name); and an x and y coordinates.</li>
                <li>You can find coordindates by hand by searching the location on Google Maps,
                    right clicking on the red location icon, and then clicking on the coordinates
                    that pop up, which will automatically copy them. </li>
                <li>You can use more columns as needed for your project. For example, in this
                    tutorial, my CSV has a "count" column, to count the number of classes I had in
                    each campus building.</li>
                <li>Save the sheet as a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your document should look something like: </p>
            <img src="csv-example.jpg" alt="example" />-->
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Creating a Map!</h2>
            <p>First, grab some sample GeoJSON input data, <a
                    href="https://github.com/pickettj/dh-class-repo/blob/main/geomapping/central_asia_sample_data.geojson"
                    >such as this file detailing the geographic origins of Central Asian
                    scholars</a> in the late nineteenth century.</p>
            <p> Then log in to your ArcGIS Online account. Pitt pays for the licensing, so <b>you
                    must login through Pitt.</b> This can be done by going to <a
                    href="https://www.arcgis.com/index.html">ArcGIS Online</a>, clicking "Sign In"
                in the upper right hand corner, and choosing to sign in through an organization and
                finding Pitt. </p>
            <h3>Creating a Feature Layer from GeoJSON</h3>
            <p> Once you are logged in, follow the next steps to add data to your content. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on Content on the navigation bar.</li>
                <li>Click on "New item" in the upper left hand corner.</li>
                <li>From this prompt you can open from th Github URL directly; or drag or uplaod a
                    file from your harddrive</li>
                <li>Choose the first (default) item - "Add [file name] and create a hosted feature
                    layer or table." We want to create a layer. We add layers to create maps! Click
                    next.</li>
                <li>Check to make sure that the types are correct and then click next.</li>
                <!--<li>If your CSV names are "lat" "latitude" "long" or "longitude," ArcGIS normally
                    recognizes these correctly as the location field types. However, double check
                    this and then click next.</li>-->
                <li>Give the item a title (or accept the default title based on the file name).</li>
                <li>Add a couple tags. This would allow someone else to search for your data.</li>
                <li>Add a summary, giving credit where it is due.</li>
                <li>Click Save; ArcGIS will automatically open the overview of the layer you just
                    created.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Opening the Feature Layer in a Map</h3>
            <p>Click on "Open in Map Viewer" to see the layer you just created. Here, you will see
                that ArcGIS automatically placed all of the items from your CSV on the map. It used
                points as default. You can click around here to get a feel for the online software.
                One thing to note is that you can click on a point and a "pop-up" will show up. This
                will show all of the information you imported about that point from your
                GeoJSON.</p>
            <h3>Styling Your Map</h3>
            <p>There are so many cool things you can do to style a map in ArcGIS online. Just like
                all of the other things you have used in this course, this is super google-able. If
                you want to try something else from this tutorial, google it! In this tutorial, I am
                going to show a couple of important ways to stylize a map: </p>
            <h4>Adding More Layers</h4>
            <p>You can continue to upload data to ArcGIS Online, following the steps above.Then, in
                a map, you can click the "Add" button under the "Layers" Pane and search through
                your content (or public content in the Living Atlas) to add to your map. You can
                toggle these layers on and off by clicking on the eye-shaped button. </p>
            <h4>Styling Point Data</h4>
            <p>Let's say I am making a map of all of the buildings on campus that I have had class.
                I don't like the default colors chosen (or, more realistically, I have multiple
                layers and want to style them with different colors). This can be done by: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Clicking the three dots on the layer you want to style (in the Layer Pane on the
                    left)</li>
                <li>Choose "Show Properties", and a new pane should pop up on the right.</li>
                <li>Click "edit layer style."</li>
                <li>Choose "style options."</li>
                <li>Click the little pencil icon to choose a new style.</li>
                <li>I am going to choose the circle under "Basic Shapes" and then click the back
                    arrow (next to "Change Symbol").</li>
                <li>Staying in this pop-up, you can edit the color, size, outline, etc.</li>
                <li>I am going to make, for example, my circles a light purple, 18 px, 0%
                    transparency, with a black 1.5px outline.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>NOTE:</b> Maps don't automatically save! You <b>must save them manually</b>. This
                can be done on the left-most pane.</p>
            <p>Here is what my map looks like with this point data:</p>
            <img src="point-data-map.jpg" alt="map1" />
            <h4>Aggregation Data</h4>
            <p>The provided GeoJSON file has an "Origin" property associated with each coordinate:
                these are the number of scholars in nineteenth century Central Asia who originated
                from the location in question. Let's size the points on the map based on that number
                to visualize the geographic origins of Central Asian elites:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Clicking the three dots on the layer you want to style (in the Layer Pane on the
                    left): select "Show properties.</li>
                <li>Select "Edit layer style.</li>
                <li>Select "+ Field"</li>
                <li>Select "Origins" and then "Add"</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That will get you to some basic circles proportionately sized to a Property of your
                GeoJSON: which is exactly what you need to do for this assignment (but using your
                own data derived from Digital Mitford).</p>
