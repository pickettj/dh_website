                <h4 id="course-objective">Course Objective</h4>
                <p>This course seeks to impart an understanding of the
                Islamic tradition by exploring the religion’s formative
                period. The first centuries of Islam are fascinating for
                many of the same reasons they are complex and even
                controversial: our primary sources are fragmented,
                partisan, and often retrospective; a tremendous range of
                voices competed to define the new religion; and nearly
                all subsequent Muslim thinkers would harken back to this
                period to legitimize their own positions. In other
                words, the history of the formation of Islam remains
                dynamic, charged, and relevant to the present day. We
                will endeavor to develop an understanding of the
                diversity of voices in this early period and consider
                why certain conceptualizations of theology, law, and
                philosophy displaced others; and then follow those
                voices beyond the Arabian origins of the new religion to
                examine its manifestation in the North African and
                Central / South Asian borderlands.</p>
                <h4 id="organization-of-course-content">Organization of
                Course Content</h4>
                <p>The course integrates two intertwined themes: (1)
                early Islamic empires as geopolitical formations; and
                (2) the development of ideas within the religious
                tradition. We will begin by spending significant time on
                the pre-Islamic period, examining both imperial and
                theological continuities between late antiquity and
                Islam. Then we will follow one of the fastest expanding
                empires in world history as the early Islamic polity
                advanced of the Arabian Peninsula. Simultaneously, we
                will consider the development of Islamic scripture
                (Qur’an and Hadith), early theological disputes,
                scientific advancement, and the consolidation of a legal
                tradition. The course concludes on the eve of the Mongol
                conquests, as the vague outlines of something resembling
                a cultural-religious consensus become discernable.</p>
                <h4 id="learning-outcomes"><a
                href="https://courses.bactriana.org/policies/learning-outcomes.html">Learning
                Outcomes</a></h4>
                <p>The principle learning outcomes of this course are
                twofold:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li>Ability to deploy original analysis through the
                engagement of primary sources</li>
                <li>The articulation of that analysis through
                evidence-based writing</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Both of these skills are developed in view of
                applying them beyond the academic field of history.</p>

                substantial flexibility. If you miss an assignment or
                class, existing systems accommodate you without separate
                communication needed. For extreme circumstances
                requiring additional accommodations beyond these
                policies, a note from your advisor is required.</p>

                <p>What is “Islam”? Is it a religion? A culture? A
                civilization? Something else entirely? And what do those
                terms even mean, anyway? How can we approach the study
                of so vast a phenomenon?</p>

                <p>No religion or culture comes out of nowhere fully
                formed – so what did the Middle East look like before
                Islam? What did the religious landscape look like in the
                Byzantine (Roman) and Persian empires? Which imperial
                traditions were already available for early Islamic
                empires to draw upon? How do we understand Christianity
                and Judaism during this time period, and what was
                Zoroastrianism?</p>

                remembered as the high point of Islamic civilization?
                Was it significant that the capital moved from Damascus
                to Baghdad? Who were the non-Muslims, and how did they
                relate to the new cultural-imperial system?</p>
